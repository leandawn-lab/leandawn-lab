First of all, I just wanted to thank you guys checking this readme file.

ðŸ‘‹I want to introduce myself first, my name is Leandawn. ðŸ‘‹
I'm a currently 18 year-old CRACKHEAD MONKE. My dream is to become ROBOTIC ENGINEER.
This is one of dream is to become a ROBOTIC ENGINEER. 
Fortunately, I accepted on my dream course: Mechatronics Engineering at one of my choice universities (currently graduating HS student).

ðŸŒ±I am interested in Robotics (Boston Dynamics), IoT (Internet of Things), ML (Machine Learning), and AI (Artificial Intelligence).ðŸŒ±
Why I am interested in these? For me to overtake humanity (just kidding I think that robots might help humans into giant leaps).

ðŸŒ±I do have a love-hate relationship to my skills. I almost give up because the complexity it is.ðŸŒ±
Even though it is difficult and complex, I need to exert effort to create personal projects for me to improve.
As one of the Youtubers Oliver Foote said,

    "Everytime that you learn something new, you have to take that thing,
    apply it into a real life project, and put it in a place where people see it."
    
How to reach me?

    Well I don't have any linkedIn or something.. but I'll create one..
